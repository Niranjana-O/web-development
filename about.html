                        The power of human empathy, leading to collective action, saves lives, and frees prisoners. Ordinary people, whose personal well-being and security are assured, join together in huge numbers to save people they do not know, and will never meet… Unlike any other creature on this planet, humans can learn and understand, without having experienced. They can think themselves into other people’s places… We do not need magic to change the world, we carry all the power we need inside ourselves already: we have the power to imagine better. </p>

                       <i>Did you know that financial giving rose almost 4% between 2015 and 2016? In 2016, it is estimated that over 390 billion dollars were donated to US charities. Talk about impact! Individual donors (people like you and me) make up 72% of all donations. We have seen an interesting shift in fundraising over the last few years moving towards greater involvement from donors in the fund collection process. According to recent data peer to peer fundraising makes up nearly 1/3 of all online donations and social fundraising has grown by 70% since 2014.

There has never been a more important time to influence people to give than right now! Today, nearly 69% of Americans provide financial support to at least one cause.

Even as the process for fundraising changes year over year and new avenues for giving and collecting are developed the goal of impact remains the same.
